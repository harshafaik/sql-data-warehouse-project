# Data Warehouse & ETL Pipeline 🚀

This project builds a **data warehouse** using **PostgreSQL** and implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to process and analyze historical **Bitcoin trends** and their correlation with macroeconomic indicators (inflation, stock indices, etc.).

## 📌 Features
- **Data Warehousing**: Multi-layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- **ETL Pipeline**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading into PostgreSQL
- **Data Processing**: Cleansing, aggregation, and enrichment
- **Dashboarding**: Insights visualized through interactive dashboards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **PostgreSQL** (Database & Data Warehouse)
- **DBeaver** (SQL Development)
- **Python / Pandas** (Data Transformation)
- **Databricks (Future Upgrade)** (For scaling ETL processes)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (Dashboard Visualization)

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Extract**: Raw data ingestion from multiple sources
2. **Transform**: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering
3. **Load**: Structured storage in PostgreSQL (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers)
4. **Analyze**: Query optimization and dashboard visualization
